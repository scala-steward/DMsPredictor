### Assumptions

### Limitations

- Currently the Cleric will only use _Turn Undead_ if the creature it is targeting,
determined by the provided `Focus`, is _Undead_. An improvement would be to search all enemies to favour Undead.

This is available to work on, see [Issue 21](https://github.com/tjheslin1/DMsPredictor/issues/21)
